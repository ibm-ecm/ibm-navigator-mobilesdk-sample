# Sample Application for IBM Navigator Mobile SDK for iOS

Sample Application to demonstrate the features of IBM Navigator Mobile SDK for iOS

** The IBM Navigator Mobile 3.4.0.6 SDK binary framework, Swift 5.0, and Xcode 12.4 or later, are required  to compile the sample app. Refer to the [README pdf](/IBMNavigatorMobileSDK_Readme.pdf) for detailed instructions on how to obtain the framework. ** 

## Usage

Simply place IBMECMCore.framework in the same folder as the workspace file (not the project file,) build and run on simulator. You can connect only to IBM Content Navigator V3.0.0 or later (more information [here](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/content-navigator))

## Misc

The Xcode project is meant to be used with Cocoapods. For simplicity, we have included the 'Pods' generated project. You can generate your own by executing 'pod install' inside the folder with the workspace file. See documentation on how to install cocoapods on your development workstation.
